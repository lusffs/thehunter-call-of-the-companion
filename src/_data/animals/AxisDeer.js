  hunterTips:[
  "Sit in a stand and call a few times. Axis Deer are animals that roam and don't stop roaming after a while, they are really active. If you sit in a stand by their hot spots you should be set.",
  "Slowly walk around parts of the map where you can find them and wait until you get a buck scream. They are everywhere so there is a high chance of running into a few herds in minutes.",
  "Set the time to 5:30 and run around lakes. Shoot everything in sight and eventually, you should run into a diamond or a rare."
